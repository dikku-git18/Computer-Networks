What is Computer Networking?
Computer networking refers to connected computing devices (such as laptops, desktops, servers, smartphones, and tablets) and an ever-expanding array of IoT devices 
(such as cameras, door locks, doorbells, refrigerators, audio/visual systems, thermostats, and various sensors) that communicate with one another.
Computer Network means an interconnection of autonomous (standalone) computers for information exchange.

BASIC TERMS:
Client: A client is a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server. The server is often (but not always) located on a 
separate physical computer.

Server: A server is a physical computer dedicated to run services to serve the needs of other computers. Depending on the servicethat is running, it could be a file 
server, database server, home media server, print server, or web server.

Host: A host is a computer, connected to other computers for which it provides data or services over a network. In theory, every computer connected to a network acts 
as a host to other peers on the network. In essence, a host reflects the logical relationship of two or more computers on a network.
A host must have an assigned IP address.

What is difference between the Internet and the Web?
The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred to formally as World Wide Web (www) is a collection of information that is accessed via the 
Internet. Another way to look at this difference is; the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is served on top of that infrastructure. Alternatively, the Internet
can be viewed as a big book store while the Web can be viewed as a collection of books on that store. At a high level, we can even think of the Internet as hardware
and the Web as software!

Web applications use HTTP protocol which is a layer over TCP protocol. Whereas internet applications can use either TCP or UDP protocol.
To visualize the difference think of it as the internet is a network of many computers connected together so you can use any port say 90 to send or receive data whereas 
in web port is fixed as HTTP uses port 80 to communicate and also the data which is sent is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So if you want a feel of internet application make
a socket connection at a random port and send data to another computer via the socket. So in this case you are using the internet for communication and not the web.

Networking Devices:
1) Repeaters:(at physical Layer)
  ->Physical Layer
  ->2-port device
  ->Forwarding of the incoming signal
  ->NO-filtering of the signal, because it is purely hardware.
  ->Collision is possible here, maximum 'n' collisions are possible.

2)Hub:(at physical layer)
  ->Multi-port repeater, in which multiple ports are available with some extra functionality to detect some error happenning.
  ->Forwarding, similar as repeater
  ->No - filtering: since it is purely hardware , no filtering is there , it broadcast the signal to each devices connected to it.
  ->high traffic is there , high collision is also there.

3)Bridges:(Used at physical layer and data link layer , Layer 2 device , )
  ->2 -port device.
  ->used to connect two different LANs.
  ->Forwarding of the signal is there, and it can be done in two ways :
    ->1) static bridge:
        ->A table is maintained which stores the MAC address of all the devices as well there port no., and administrator have to 
          update this manually, so this is not the efficient way.
      2) Transparent Bridge:
        ->Initially bridge do not contain any info, once it recieves any packet it broadcast it to every device and based on that it maintains the table .
  ->Filtering is there in the bridges, they are used at the DDL so they MAC address for that.
  ->No - collision or less collision is there, because bridges uses the buffer, to store and forward the packet , this minimises the collision.
  ->Bridge Data unit protocol: it is used to make spanning tree so that packet cannot be in infinite loop.

4)Switch:(Layer 2 device,data link layer) 
-> Multiport bridge
->Full duplex , so that no collision is there.
->A separate circuit is formed when a device is sending the packet to another device, so collison is minimised.

5)Router: (Layer 3 , Network Layer )
  ->IP address is used for forwarding a packect; and routers using the routing table for that.
  ->filtering :  filtering is done if we want to know the MAC address, we send ARP rerquest to the router , 
  -> No collision is there , because it also used the store and forward method.

LAN(Local Area Network):
  LAN stands for local area network. It is a group of network devices that allow communication between various connected devices. Private ownership has
  control over the local area network rather than the public. LAN has a short propagation delay than MAN as well as WAN. It covers smaller areas such as 
  colleges, schools, hospitals, and so on. 
MAN (metropolitan area Network):
  MAN stands for metropolitan area network. It covers a larger area than LAN such as small towns, cities, etc. MAN connects two or more computers that 
  reside within the same or completely different cities. MAN is expensive and should or might not be owned by one organization. 
WAN (wide area Network):
  WAN stands for wide area network. It covers a large area than LAN as well as a MAN such as country/continent etc. WAN is expensive and should or might
  not be owned by one organization. PSTN or satellite medium is used for wide area networks.
